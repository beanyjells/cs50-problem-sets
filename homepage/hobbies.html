        There are a number of things that I enjoy, including but not limited to:

                <h5 class="mt-0">K-POP</h5>
                I love kpop. It started as a guilty pleasure, introduced by my best friend, but now it's turned into obsession that I'm not afraid to talk about. My fave kpop groups are:

                <div class="media mt-3">

                    </a>
                 <div class="media-body">
                    <h5 class="mt-0">BTS</h5>
                    BTS fuelled my kpop obsession. They started off as underdogs in the kpop industry, being part of an unknown label, and grew to the biggest, most accomplished korean boy group in the world. Their (mostly) original music with relatable lyrics, complex dance moves and captivating visuals are altogether a complete package that few can deny is anything short of amazing.

                  <div class="media-body">
                    <h5 class="mt-0">MONSTA X</h5>
                    Monsta X is a recent favourite of mine. An older group that debuted just 3 years ago, Monsta X has been making waves internationally, portraying a stronger image than the typical kpop boy group. They enthrall with their powerful dance moves, not-so-shy appearances and fist-pumping tunes.

                Dogs are the best. I can't say much other than I'd like several fur-babies to spoil. I can't decide which my favourite breed is as I have several. See <a href="Dogs.html">here</a> to know more.

                <h5 class="mt-0">CATS</h5>
                If for some reason I can't have a dog, I'd be happy to have a cat. I never <strong>loved</strong> cats per se.. until I met my friend Neha's tabby named Izzy. The kitty is so sweet, lovable and yearns for pets.. she might as well be a dog. So I'd be happy with a dog-like cat! See more about the kind of cat I'd like <a href="Cats.html">here</a>.
